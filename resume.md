(Dec 2014 - present)
:    **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle**



Working on the software aspect of an autonomous underwater Vehicle @ [TeamAUV](http://auviitkgp.github.io/), guided by Dr. Cheruvu Siva Kumar, IIT Kharagpur

* Designed and implemented a [integrated mission planner](https://github.com/pranaypratyush/kraken_3.0/tree/buoy_detect_temp/vision_stack/buoy_detect/src), that required knowledge of multithreading, interprocess communication and networking APIs on linux

* Built a machine learning based [pixel classification system](https://github.com/pranaypratyush/kraken_3.0/tree/buoy_detect_temp/vision_stack/buoy_detect/vw_detect/src) for detection of underwater features, that required knowledge of basic machine learning and image processing

* Wrote a [Kalman filter](https://github.com/pranaypratyush/kalman_filter/tree/legacy) for position estimation of AUV by fusion of IMU and DVL sensor data

* Deviced a PID controller for yaw control of the AUV

* Currently working on a machine learning based feature classification framework to detect underwater objects and their characteristics

(Feb 2015)
:    **Interactive software for extracting data from graphs**

Created an interactive software that took documents and images with graphs as input
and returned the numerical data from the graphs in a tabular form


(Sep 2015)
:    **Graphics Editor System**


Built a JAVA software that supports basic image editing functions
